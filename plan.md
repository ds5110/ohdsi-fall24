### Project Goal

Our project will establish stroke patient ‘paths’ through treatment, to further disaggregate the initial cohort definition that captures first-occurance in-patient and emergency department stroke diagnosis. We will focus our path on physical location of patients while receiving treatment, and indication of whether they have received physical/occupational and/or speech therapy. The objective is to create defined paths that will support future research on the efficacy of different treatment processes, timing, and duration.
