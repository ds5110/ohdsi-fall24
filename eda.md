# Exploratory Data Analysis

Per instructions in the class repo:

- Add an "eda.md" file to your repository that includes the following...
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) should demonstrate data accessibility.
- The data should be visualized in a manner that adds insights on the project's analytic objectives & proposal.
- Use results of the EDA to demonstrate that your project objectives are feasible.
- Figures should support the feasibility of the project objectives.
- Create a "docs/draft.md" that describes your EDA and proposal to the general public.
- EDA will be graded like a hoomework assignment.
- "eda.md" must be reproducible following the guidance in https://ds5110/git-intro
