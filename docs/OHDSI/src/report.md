## Background

Stroke survivors receive rehabilitation services (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech-language therapy) in different locations at different rates in the period following their stroke. Differences between levels of care location as well as type of care delivered has been identified as a path to understanding the differences in the quality of stroke post-acute treatment in order to optimize stroke outcomes.

Our hypothesis is that it is possible to use OHDSI data to trace the various paths that stroke survivors take through post-incident care so that the efficacy and efficiency of the different care transitions can be evaluated.

## Next Steps

As technology continues to advance and global interest in space exploration grows, the future promises even more exciting developments in the realm of rocket launches and space travel.

Exploration will not only be limited to the Moon or Mars, but extend to other parts of our solar system such as Jupiter and Saturnâ€™s moons, and beyond.
